Typically one of the meanings is obvious, given the context whereas the other may require more thought. The innuendo may convey a message that would be socially awkward, sexually suggestive, or offensive to state directly (the ""Oxford English Dictionary"" describes a double entendre as being used to ""convey an indelicate meaning"", whilst Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English defines it as ""a word or phrase that may be understood in two different ways, one of which is often sexual"")."

It is the only known crystalline geoporphyrin .,"Porphyrins are a group of heterocyclic macrocycle organic compounds, composed of four modified pyrrole subunits interconnected at their α carbon atoms via methine bridges (=CH−). The parent porphyrin is porphin, and substituted porphines are called porphyrins. The porphyrin ring structure is aromatic, with a total of 26 electrons in the conjugated system. Various analyses indicate that not all atoms of the ring are involved equally in the conjugation or that the molecule's overall nature is substantially based on several smaller conjugated systems. One result of the large conjugated system is that porphyrin molecules typically have very intense absorption bands in the visible region and may be deeply colored; the name ""porphyrin"" comes from the Greek word πορφύρα (""porphyra""), meaning ""purple"".","Porphin, sometimes spelled porphine, is the parent chemical compound for types of biochemically significant compounds called porphyrins.

It is produced from the sugary secretions of plants or insects, such as floral nectar or aphid honeydew, through regurgitation, enzymatic activity, and water evaporation. The variety of honey produced by honey bees (the genus ""Apis"") is the most well-known, due to its worldwide commercial production and human consumption.
Honey gets its sweetness from the monosaccharides fructose and glucose, and has about the same relative sweetness as granulated sugar. It has attractive chemical properties for baking and a distinctive flavor that leads some people to prefer it to sugar and other sweeteners. Most microorganisms do not grow in honey, so sealed honey does not spoil, even after thousands of years. However, honey sometimes contains dormant endospores of the bacterium ""Clostridium botulinum"", which can be dangerous to babies, as it may result in botulism.
People who have a weakened immune system should not eat honey because of the risk of bacterial or fungal infection. Although some evidence indicates honey may be effective in treating diseases and other medical conditions, such as wounds and burns, the overall evidence for its use in therapy is not conclusive. Providing 64 calories in a typical serving of one tablespoon (15 ml) equivalent to 1272 kj per 100 g, honey has no significant nutritional value. Honey is generally safe, but may have various, potential adverse effects or interactions with excessive consumption, existing disease conditions, or drugs.
Honey use and production have a long and varied history as an ancient activity, depicted in Valencia, Spain by a cave painting of humans foraging for honey at least 8,000 years ago.","Spain, officially the Kingdom of Spain, is a sovereign state largely located on the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe, with two large archipelagos, the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea and the Canary Islands off the North African Atlantic coast, two cities Ceuta and Melilla in the North African mainland and several small islands in the Alboran Sea near the Moroccan coast.

By the Age of Enlightenment, literature had grown in importance, and from the early 1830s, Russian literature underwent an astounding golden age in poetry, prose and drama.

The Nationalist Party did not enter the House of Commons of Northern Ireland until 1924 , having won six seats in the general election of 1921 . In 1965 , it agreed to become the official opposition party in the House of Commons . On 20 June 1968 , Austin Currie , Nationalist Party MP at Stormont , with others , began a protest about discrimination in housing allocation by ' squatting ' ( illegally occupying ) a house in Caledon , County Tyrone . The house had been allocated by Dungannon Rural District Council to a 19 - year - old unmarried Protestant woman , Emily Beattie , who was the secretary of a local Unionist politician . Emily Beattie was given the house ahead of older married Catholic families with children . The protesters were evicted by officers of the Royal Ulster Constabulary ( RUC ) , one of whom was Emily Beattie 's brother . The next day the annual conference of the Nationalist Party unanimously approved of the protest action by Austin Currie in Caledon .
